# TODO: Below rule preserves <ZWJ, VIRAMA> wherever it occurs.
# Even though explicit ya-phalaa using ZWJ is relevant only for special
# cases like <RA, ZWJ, VIRAMA,YA>. Even then, cases like
# <KA, VIRAMA, RA, ZWJ, VIRAMA, YA> does not need ZWJ as the rakar will be on
# the KA rather than a reph over the YA. This solution precludes all those
# required special handling.
