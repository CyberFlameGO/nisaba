uname_prefix: "LEPCHA CONSONANT SIGN"

# Syllable finals.
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Lepcha has no virama. Explicit final consonants are used where there is no
# inherent vowel.

# The following two final consonants represent velar nasal `-ṅ`: `NYIN-DO` is
# used only when there is no vowel matra, KANG is used in all other instances.
#
# TODO: The above principle is rather often violated in the observed
# data. Examples: `KANG` after subjoined consonants ("ᰜᰤᰵᰋᰨᰩ"), `KANG` after
# consonant ("ᰊᰰᰶᰚᰵᰓᰨᰫ"), `NYIN-DO` after vowel sign ("ᰕᰳᰃᰨᰴ"). Ideally `NYIN-DO`
# should move to `subjoined_consonants`, but it's not clear how widespread the
# confusion between the two is.
