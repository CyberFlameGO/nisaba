This directory contains the unidirectional romanization mappings for Manipuri
written in Bengali script. The romanizer is unidirectional because it performs a
many-to-one mapping.

The romanized output has to match the inverse of the native Meetei Mayek
romanizer in Nisaba so that both FSTs compose to form Bengali to Meetei Mayek
transliterator.

Note, the mappings in this directory are *not* compiled into the main Nisaba
transducers, they are designed to be used by custom transducer pipeline
implementing Bengali to Meetei Mayek transliteration.

This implementation is based on the following sources:
